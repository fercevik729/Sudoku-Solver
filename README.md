# Sudoku-Solver
This is a simple text-based sudoku solver.
To use: update the Sudokus text file with the 81 numbers you want for your Sudoku puzzle.
Make sure that each of these numbers are space-separated and are within the range of 0-9
where 0 represents an empty cell and 1-9 represents a filled out cell. The program will
print out a textual representation of the unsolved puzzle, then a solved representation of
it.
